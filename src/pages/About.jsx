          Hello and thank you for taking the time to visit my portfolio! My name
          is Mark and I am an aspiring full stack web developer residing in
          Windsor, Ontario. I have been programming since 2018 and recently
          received my Computer Programming diploma from Georgian College. I also
          have a Bachelor of Science in Biology from Trent University but
          decided to make a career change that is more in line with my passions.
          I began learning to code with Java and have since worked with a
          variety of other languages including JavaScript, PHP, C#, C++, and
          Swift. After working with all of these, JavaScript has become my
          language of choice due to it's popularity, active community, and
          flexibiltiy to be used in both front-end and back-end development.
        </p>

          I love web development and am passionate about learning new techs that
          I can apply to future projects. Currently, I am very comfortable
          working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and am very good at building
          web applications that are pixel perfect to the design requirements.
          Over the last year, I have mostly focused on learning TypeScript,
          React, and Redux. I am always open to learning new techs to improve my
          skills and stay up to date with the latest industry trends. In my
          spare time, I enjoy playing video games, watching movies or youtube,
          and socializing with friends.
        </p>

          I consider myself to be a very fast learner and a hard worker. I
          always try my best and use every challenge as an opportunity to learn.
          If you think I would be a good fit for your team, you can contact me
          through any of the methods provided on the contact page. I look
          forward to speaking with you!
